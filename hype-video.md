    3. Do you also hate the monotonous initial face of wipping up a project? 
    (COMAND LINE: LARAVEL NEW APP)
        - You have to manually crate the database
        (COMANDLINE: CREATE THE DB)
        - set the env 
        (IN EDITOR CHANGING A THE PARAMETERS IN ENV)
        - write a lot of cli-commands with flags that are easily forgotten yada yada yada
        (COMANDLINE: WRITE A LOT OF DIFFERENT MAKE CONTROLLERS OCH SÅNNT MED OLIKA FLAGGOR SOM BLIR FEL)
        - then when you are finaLly done you realize you need to change something and a small change leads to a lot of tedious work.
        (EDITOR VISA HUR DU DELETAR MASSA FILER)
        
    4. At this point you might get tempted to create your own boilerplates only to find them outdated faster than you have been able to make them worth to make from the beginning.
        (VISA HUR DU SAVEAR BOILER PLATE - SEN VISA HUR DU INSTALLERAR NÅGOT SOM SAKNAR DEPENDENCIES)
        
    5. Now you get tempted to install generators that end up clutter your project by beeing both to complex and to specific to be at some real help.
        (VISA README PÅ NÅGON GENERATOR OCH KANSKE INSTALLERA NÅGON OCH VISA ALLA FILER DEN GENERERAR)

## Problem definition
Have you ever wanted to whip up a new Laravel project just to find your self spending Hours on the inital setup?
And halfway through you need to add a class, rename ten migrations, 
insert relationships or something else and Suddenly, you are back at square one. 
To save time you might try to clutter your project with complex generators, 
but after a while you end up crying in foetal position in your bedroom corner. 

## Short description
Introducing the Stimpack ecosystem. Stimpack is a web development accelerator and project manipulator built on the Laravel framework. 
A beautiful web interface allows you to create workflows for common tasks, 
such as setting up a new project or to add standard functionallity to exist apps.
Share or reuse packs in the cloud with the stimpack.io community. 
And of course everything you design is instantly available in your command line. 
Nuff' talkin, lets have a look at some examples!

## FAST PACED DEMO OF THE THREE CASES
* You might know of the laravel installer. What if we could modify the result of that. Well now we can.
Use a Create Manipulator, along with a few others to set specific env, create database, insert stuff in gitignore etc.
The benefit is you dont need to maintain a boilerplate Destined to grow old.
* Next lets say you need to add a privacy policy, heard about GDPR right? Add a Load manipulator to modify a existing project and inject a blade view. Cool!
* Finally lets have a look at a more complex example. We are super stoked about this.
You can create a fullfeathered object model extremely fast. And becaouse migrate and seed are available as Manipulators,
we can instantly whip up a basic API.
* All of these examples are available in the stimpack.io data cloud.
* Now, youre one of those hardcore CLI guys? We get it we love that to. 
Thats why all your saved packs are available in the command line automatically.
