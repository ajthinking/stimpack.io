## Problem definition
Have you ever wanted to whip up a new Laravel project just to find your self spending Hours on the inital setup?
And halfway through you need to add a class, rename ten migrations, 
insert relationships or something else and Suddenly, you are back at square one. 
To save time you might try to clutter your project with complex generators, 
but after a while you end up crying in foetal position in your bedroom corner. 

## Short description
Introducing the Stimpack ecosystem. Stimpack is a web development accelerator and project manipulator built on the Laravel framework.

such as setting up a new project or to add standard functionallity to exist apps.

And of course everything you design is instantly available in your command line. 
Nuff' talkin, lets have a look at some examples!

## FAST PACED DEMO OF THE THREE CASES
* You might know of the laravel installer. What if we could modify the result of that. Well now we can.
Use a Create Manipulator, along with a few others to set specific env, create database, insert stuff in gitignore etc.
The benefit is you dont need to maintain a boilerplate Destined to grow old.
* Next lets say you need to add a privacy policy, heard about GDPR right? Add a Load manipulator to modify a existing project and inject a blade view. Cool!
* Finally lets have a look at a more complex example. We are super stoked about this.
You can create a fullfeathered object model extremely fast. And becaouse migrate and seed are available as Manipulators,
we can instantly whip up a basic API.
* All of these examples are available in the stimpack.io data cloud.
* Now, youre one of those hardcore CLI guys? We get it we love that to. 
Thats why all your saved packs are available in the command line automatically.
